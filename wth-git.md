# wth are these ? it must be stopped
## branch
- is a pointer to one specific commit
- doesn't have to diverge from a graph
- it only diverges if a commit is made on a common ancestor commit
- two commits might be on different branch
- to delete a branch, we must checkout other branch 
- if we click delete both local/br and origin/br, only the origin will be delete, but the local will still stay (if we're still on br)
- be **VERY CAREFUL WHEN RESETING LOCAL BRANCH TO REMOTE BRANCH, YOUR WORK MIGHT BE LOSS**


# git rebase
# fork
# pull request
# stashing
# pop
# git pull remote branch ??
# git cherry pick ?
# git merge ?

# why the fuck would they say **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**
